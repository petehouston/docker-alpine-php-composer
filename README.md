A very small Docker image to bootstrap your PHP development.

This Docker image is based on [petehouston/docker-alpine-php](https://github.com/petehouston/docker-alpine-php) but with [Composer](getcomposer.org) supported.

### Support Versions

Following PHP versions are supported,

### How to use?

```
$ docker pull petehouston/docker-alpine-php-composer

Then run the `composer` command in the mount directory

```
$ docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/home -w /home petehouston/docker-alpine-php-composer:5.6 composer require phpunit/phpunit
